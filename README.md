COMP171 - Assignment 5

Short discussion of the differences between our design and our implementation and any limitations the software imposed on what we were able to do

Our design was done in Microsoft Powerpoint while our implementation is done in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It is hosted at mfeltz.github.io/comp171 through Github pages (gh-pages). Source code can be found at https://github.com/mfeltz/comp171. The implementation fits the screen size of an iPhone 6.

Our implementation is simpler than our design because it is much more difficult to implement a software design than it is to simply create a bunch of screenshot slides in PowerPoint. For example, in the software prototype, each button must be able to react to the user’s input, usually in the form of a finger touch. On the coding side, this requires code attached to each button to be triggered and run when the user’s finger touches the button. To stick to the essence of our project’s interface, we have removed the Apple Cinnamon sundae ordering in the implementation, as it is simply a repeat of order the Orangutan sundae. Also, for the convenience of front-end web development, we have removed the checkboxes next to adding toppings to the sundaes.

One major advantage in using HTML, CSS, and Javascript is the ease in implementing the home and back buttons. The home and back buttons stay in the same place in the screens and link to the home and previous page, respectively. This home page button is harder to implement in Powerpoint. Usually, the user is forced to keep clicking the back button until the user reaches the home page.

Our implementation doesn’t implement scrolling down a list of toppings or ice cream sundaes but scrolling is not something we can fully implement in PowerPoint either, so there is no loss of functionality or limitation here. Similarly, our implementation doesn’t implement changing the quantity of ice cream sundaes as shown with the number keypad in the design but the number keypad is not something we can fully implement in PowerPoint either, so there is no loss of functionality or limitation here. 

For the card and address information, we chose to fade in the information rather than to let the user type in information because allowing keyboard input would require a HTML form to retrieve and store the user’s information. This is beyond the scope that we were trying to achieve.

While more complex and time intensive, the HTML, CSS, and Javascript implementation offers a live, in-the-moment experience that running through Powerpoint slides simply cannot offer. The user feels he or she is actually using a realistic application, rather than a non-interactive and boring slideshow. The user can navigate to our URL of mfeltz.github.io/comp171 from a mobile device and click on the buttons to simulate ordering a sundae.
